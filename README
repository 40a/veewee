Before we can actually build the boxes, we need to take care of the minimal things to install

0)Have ruby and rubygems working

1)To avoid messing up your installed gems, it's to start from an empty gem list
#To avoid needing Root access =>
$ . veewee.ENV

2)The minimal thing you need is the rake gem
$ gem install rake

3)You would also want to have Virtualbox installed
curl http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/3.2.10/VirtualBox-3.2.10-66523-OSX.dmg
