The installation uses the Standard way for Windows Unattended installation. The XML file was created using the Windows AIK kit, but the file can also be edited by hand.

- Building the machine creates a floppy that contains:
  - AutoUnattend.xml (that will configure the windows)
  - cygwin-setup.exe (the standard setup.exe cygwin binaries)
  - cygwin-install.bat (this script will run the cygwin installer + get sshd/openssl going)
  - winrm-install.bat (activates the http and https listener + punches the firewall hole)
